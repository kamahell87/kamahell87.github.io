Hello stranger and welcome!\
_**- Hi! Thank you**_\
My name is Marco and this is my personal _madhouse_.\
_**- What do you mean?**_\
I mean that in this website you can read about my homelab and self-hosted adventures. Long story short, you can read
about how I try to learn new things, setting up new services, without getting mad.\
_**- Interesting... Who are you again?**_\
I am an italian guy who moved to the UK to work. I am passionate about IT and my heart is powered by Linux.\
_**- Cool! What are the main topics you're interested in?**_\
Virtualization and containers mainly, with a sprinkle of automation.\
_**- Sounds amazing! Let me take a look around**_\
_Mi casa es tu casa_
