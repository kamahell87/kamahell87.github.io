A1ic3 loved exploring the vast digital wilderness, but she was tired of relying on third-party platforms to host her website. She yearned for independence, control, and a dash of chaos.

I spent the last year learning, tinkering, testing, getting mad… but I’m still here, ready to do it again and again! Doing all these things while in a full time job is not easy.
