I believe we all agree that automate updates (_in general_) might not be a good idea. If we are talking about Docker images, we need to
monitor the registries to see if a new release is out, than read the release notes and decide whether to update to the new version or not.\
Well, what if I tell you that we can at least skip the monitoring part and get a notification to our phone when a new version of an image is released?
Maybe it doesn't seem much, but if you like to manage your time as efficiently as possible, like I do, you can see the benefit of it.\
Let me introduce you [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/)! Long story short, Diun receives a notification when a Docker image
is updated on a Docker registry.\
As you can see in the documentation, you can run Diun in different ways, but I chose docker-compose.\
_What a surprise!_
```bash
mkdir diun
cd diun
touch docker-compose.yml
nano docker-compose.yml
```
`docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
---
version: "3.5"

services:
  diun:
    image: crazymax/diun:latest
    container_name: diun
    command: serve
    volumes:
      - "./data:/data"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
    environment:
      - "TZ=Europe/London"
      - "LOG_LEVEL=info"
      - "LOG_JSON=false"
      - "DIUN_WATCH_WORKERS=20"
      - "DIUN_WATCH_SCHEDULE=0 0 09 * * *"
      - "DIUN_PROVIDERS_DOCKER=true"
    labels:
      - "diun.enable=true"
    restart: unless-stopped
```
I changed the schedule to make it run every day at 09:00 (take a look at [CRON Expressions Format](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format)
if you need). \
_But how do we get notified?_\
Diun supports many services, but for this kind of projects I usually choose Telegram.\
Set up a Telegram Bot which will send the notifications and, once done, add some environment variables in the `docker-compose` file:
```yaml
- DIUN_NOTIF_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=
- DIUN_NOTIF_TELEGRAM_CHATIDS= #can be more than one (comma separated)
- DIUN_NOTIF_TELEGRAM_TEMPLATEBODY=
```
You can reference the [documentation](https://crazymax.dev/diun/notif/telegram/) to find more details, including the
default `templateBody` which you can modify according to your needs. **Highly recommended if you run Diun on multiple machines**.\
Now we can finally spin it up:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
**A quick note:** to make sure everything is working fine, run a test using:
```bash
sudo docker-compose exec diun diun notif test
```
You should receive a notification on your phone from your new Diun Telegram Bot.
